1. Using shapes.html/.js shows an output of a blue canvas with the text "CMPM35 2020" it is also cute
and I enjoyed adding several colorful ellipses of varying sizes.

2. The file 'CM35_eyeData.csv' is a weeks worth of data collected that describes the estimate times I have put on/taken off my 
glasses/contacts in one day. During COVID, I have been giving a lot of thought and precaution about the relationship
of interaction between my hands and my contacts/glasses.
I have uploaded several data points into the graph for row 1.
